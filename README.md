## Program Operation Concept.

The aim of the program is to populate the `WEATHER_IN_POLAND` table with data regarding weather measurements provided by the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMGW). The program is developed in Python using MySQL queries.</br>
</br>
Upon execution, the program communicates with the IMGW API, retrieves data from the moment of invocation, processes it accordingly, and then populates the database. The program's functionality has been tested on a MySQL database within a Docker environment.

## Program Execution

To execute the program, run the file `createAndPopulateWeatherMeasurement.py`
## Installation of Necessary Libraries

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

or optionally

```

## Environmental Variables
